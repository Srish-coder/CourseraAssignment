            Day 1
        </div>
        <p>
            It's surely past forty, This, the asphalt testifies. The sultry sunny Summer comes unabashedly, With a tease of skin and skin.
        </p>

        <div>
            Day 2
        </div>
        <p>
            It rose but fell under forty, Which is manifested in the sombre sky, And the advances of nimbus clouds. The gallant gusty Gales with moisture, Cut through the cheeky evening Sun.
        </p>

    <div class="part3">
        <div>
           Day 3
        </div>
        <p>
            But it's not here to be, For the Summer has a bigger appetite to reach and touch; With tease of skin and skin.
